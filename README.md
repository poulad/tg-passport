# Telegram Passport

A sample of Telegram Passport implementation.

[Demo on Heroku](https://tg-passport.herokuapp.com/)

## Getting Started

### Mongo DB

Run Mongo DB. Express app connects to `mean-ts-dev` database [by default](./src/config/env/development.ts).

If you use Docker, you can run the following container:

```bash
docker run --detach --publish 27017:27017 --name mongo-ts-dev mongo
```

### Express Web Server

Express app listens on port `3000`.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Angular App

Angular app is served on port `4200` and its calls to `localhost:4200/api` are proxied to `localhost:3000/api`.

```bash
cd ng
npm install
npm start
```

Head to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the app.

## Development

### Express

Express app is written in TypeScript and transpiled files are placed in `dist/`. The entry point of the app is [`www.js`](./bin/www.js) module. It runs the transpiled JS files in `dist/`.

```bash
# Watch TS files in "src/", transpile and copy them to "dist/"
npm run build:watch

# Watch JS files in "dist/"
npm run nodemon
```

#### Debug Express in VS Code

If you use Visual Studio Code, there are [configurations](./.vscode/) to help you with debugging the app.

1. Open app in VS Code
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + B` (Run Default Build Task) to watch TS files in "src/" and transpile them in background
1. Press F5 to debug TS files

### Angular

#### Debug Angular in VS Code

If you use Visual Studio Code, there are [configurations](./ng/.vscode/) to help you with debugging the app.

1. Open directory [`ng/`](./ng/) in VS Code
1. Install [Debugger for Chrome extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug)
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + B` (Run Default Build Task) to run `ng serve` in background
1. Press F5 to debug

## Configurations

Mongo Db connection string could be set in [config files](./src/config/env) or as `APP_MONGO` environment variable.

> If an app configuration is available both in a file and as environment variable, environment variable wins.

## Deployment

The [`build.js`](./build.js) script is used to build the app for production.

Script builds Express app and places files in `dist/`. It then builds Angular app and places the files in `dist/public/`. Express serves them as static files.

```bash
# build both apps. output files to dist/
node build.js

# run production build
node bin/www.js
```

### Heroku

App is ready to be deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). Add the following environment variables in application settings:

- `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` : `false`
- `APP_MONGO` : `mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@abc.mlab.com:51799/foo-db`
